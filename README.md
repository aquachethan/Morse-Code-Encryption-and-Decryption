# Morse-Code-Encryption-and-Decryption


In this project we will be using Arduino UNO boards, one for transmitter and another for receiver.

Here we will be transmitting the MORSE CODE through a LED and receiving the blinks of LED through the LDR sensor.

The LED will blink in accordance with the morse code dots and dashes (i.e dots will be of 10 ms and dashes will be 3X of dots, that's 30ms)

There are two part of codes, one for Transmitter and another for Receiver part.

After running it you need to input the MORSE CODE equivallent to your message which you want to transmitt.

And the same will be encoded and sent through the LED and decoded with an LDR by the help of Arduino and the decoded message will be displayed on the LCD display.
